# Capella Organizations Example

This example shows how to retrive Organization details in Capella.

This lists the organization details based on the organization ID and authentication access token.

To run, configure your Couchbase Capella provider as described in README in the root of this project.

# Example Walkthrough

In this example, we are going to do the following.

1. GET: Read and display the Capella Organization details as stated in the `get_organization.tf` file.
2. DELETE: Delete the organization data output from terraform state.

If you check the `terraform.template.tfvars` file - Make sure you copy the file to `terraform.tfvars` and update the values of the variables as per the correct organization access.

## GET

Note: You didn't use the -out option to save this plan, so Terraform can't guarantee to take exactly these actions if you run "terraform apply" now.
