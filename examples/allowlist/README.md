# Capella Allowlists Example

This example shows how to create and manage Allowlists in Capella.

This creates a new allowlist in the selected Capella cluster and lists existing allowlists in the cluster. It uses the cluster ID to create and list allowlists.

To run, configure your Couchbase Capella provider as described in README in the root of this project.

# Example Walkthrough

In this example, we are going to do the following.

1. CREATE: Create a new allowlist in Capella as stated in the `create_allowlist.tf` file.
2. UPDATE: Update the allowlist configuration using Terraform.
3. LIST: List existing allowlists in Capella as stated in the `list_allowlists.tf` file.
4. IMPORT: Import a allowlist that exists in Capella but not in the terraform state file.
5. DELETE: Delete the newly created allowlist from Capella.

If you check the `terraform.template.tfvars` file - Make sure you copy the file to `terraform.tfvars` and update the values of the variables as per the correct organization access.

```

### Note the Allowlist ID for the new Allowlist
Command: `terraform output new_allowlist`

Sample Output:
```
$ terraform output new_allowlist
{
  "audit" = {
    "created_at" = "2023-10-04 02:44:46.31810374 +0000 UTC"
    "created_by" = "osxKeibDiShFFyyqAVNvqWRaWryXBxBD"
    "modified_at" = "2023-10-04 02:44:46.31810374 +0000 UTC"
    "modified_by" = "osxKeibDiShFFyyqAVNvqWRaWryXBxBD"
    "version" = 1
  }
  "cidr" = "10.0.0.0/16"
  "cluster_id" = "f499a9e6-e5a1-4f3e-95a7-941a41d046e6"
  "comment" = "Allow access from another VPC"
  "expires_at" = "2023-11-14T21:49:58.465Z"
  "id" = "854cbdf0-8ae3-4a42-9227-59c52a5ab4f2"
  "if_match" = tostring(null)
  "organization_id" = "0783f698-ac58-4018-84a3-31c3b6ef785d"
  "project_id" = "958ad6b5-272d-49f0-babd-cc98c6b54a81"
}
```

In this case, the allowlist ID for my new allowlist is `854cbdf0-8ae3-4a42-9227-59c52a5ab4f2`

### List the resources that are present in the Terraform State file.

Command: `terraform state list`

Sample Output:
```
$ terraform state list
data.capella_allowlists.existing_allowlists
capella_allowlist.new_allowlist
```

## IMPORT
### Remove the resource `new_allowlist` from the Terraform State file

Command: `terraform state rm capella_allowlist.new_allowlist`

Sample Output:
```
$ terraform state rm capella_allowlist.new_allowlist
Removed capella_allowlist.new_allowlist
Successfully removed 1 resource instance(s).
```

Please note, this command will only remove the resource from the Terraform State file, but in reality, the resource exists in Capella.

### Now, let's import the resource in Terraform

Command: `terraform import capella_allowlist.new_allowlist id=<allowlist_id>,cluster_id=<cluster_id>,project_id=<project_id>,organization_id=<organization_id>`

In this case, the complete command is:
`terraform import capella_allowlist.new_allowlist id=854cbdf0-8ae3-4a42-9227-59c52a5ab4f2,cluster_id=f499a9e6-e5a1-4f3e-95a7-941a41d046e6,project_id=958ad6b5-272d-49f0-babd-cc98c6b54a81,organization_id=0783f698-ac58-4018-84a3-31c3b6ef785d`

Sample Output:
```
$ terraform import capella_allowlist.new_allowlist id=854cbdf0-8ae3-4a42-9227-59c52a5ab4f2,cluster_id=f499a9e6-e5a1-4f3e-95a7-941a41d046e6,project_id=958ad6b5-272d-49f0-babd-cc98c6b54a81,organization_id=0783f698-ac58-4018-84a3-31c3b6ef785d

data.capella_allowlists.existing_allowlists: Read complete after 1s

Import successful!

The resources that were imported are shown above. These resources are now in
your Terraform state and will henceforth be managed by Terraform.
```

Here, we pass the IDs as a single comma-separated string.
The first ID in the string is the allowlist ID i.e. the ID of the resource that we want to import.
The second ID is the cluster ID i.e. the ID of the cluster to which the allowlist belongs.
The third ID is the project ID i.e. the ID of the project to which the cluster belongs.
The fourth ID is the organization ID i.e. the ID of the organization to which the project belongs.

### Let's run a terraform plan to confirm that the import was successful and no resource states were impacted

Command: `terraform plan`

Sample Output:
```
$ terraform plan
╷

│  - hashicorp.com/couchabasecloud/capella in /Users/talina.shrotriya/workspace/terraform-provider-capella

```

## UPDATE
### Let us edit the terraform.tfvars file to change the allowlist configuration settings.

Command: `terraform apply -var 'allowlist={durability_level="majority",name="new_terraform_allowlist"}'`

Sample Output:
```
$ terraform apply -var comment="updated allowlist comment"
