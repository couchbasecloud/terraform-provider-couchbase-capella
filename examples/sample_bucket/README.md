# Capella Sample Buckets Example
This example shows how to create and manage sample Buckets in Capella.

This creates a new bucket in the selected Capella cluster and lists existing sample buckets in the cluster. It uses the cluster ID to create and list buckets.

To run, configure your Couchbase Capella provider as described in README in the root of this project.


# Example Walkthrough

In this example, we are going to do the following.

1. CREATE: Create a new sample bucket in Capella as stated in the `create_sample_bucket.tf` file.
2. UPDATE: Update the bucket configuration using Terraform.
3. LIST: List existing sample buckets in Capella as stated in the `list_sample_buckets.tf` file.
4. IMPORT: Import a bucket that exists in Capella but not in the terraform state file.
5. DELETE: Delete the newly created bucket from Capella.
c
If you check the `terraform.template.tfvars` file - Make sure you copy the file to `terraform.tfvars` and update the values of the variables as per the correct organization access.

### Note the Bucket ID for the new sample Bucket
Command: `terraform output new_sample_bucket`

Sample Output:
```
terraform output new_sample_bucket
{
  "bucket_conflict_resolution" = "seqno"
  "cluster_id" = "4ce95e43-106c-427f-b260-49fdb2c8b034"

  }
  "storage_backend" = "couchstore"
  "time_to_live_in_seconds" = 0
  "type" = "couchbase"
}
```


### List the resources that are present in the Terraform State file.

Command: `terraform state list`

Sample Output:
```
 terraform state list
data.couchbase-capella_sample_buckets.existing_sample_buckets
couchbase-capella_sample_bucket.new_sample_bucket
```


## IMPORT
### Remove the resource `new_sample_bucket` from the Terraform State file

Command: `terraform state rm couchbase-capella_sample_bucket.new_sample_bucket`

Sample Output:

```
terraform state rm couchbase-capella_sample_bucket.new_sample_bucket
Removed couchbase-capella_sample_bucket.new_sample_bucket
Successfully removed 1 resource instance(s).
```


### Now, let's import the resource in Terraform

Command: `terraform import couchbase-capella_sample_bucket.new_sample_bucket id=<bucket_id>,cluster_id=<cluster_id>,project_id=<project_id>,organization_id=<organization_id>`

In this case, the complete command is:
`terraform import couchbase-capella_sample_bucket.new_sample_bucket id=YmVlci1zYW1wbGU=,organization_id=6af08c0a-8cab-4c2d-c957-b521585c16d0,project_id=c1fade1a-9f27-4a3c-ki90-g1b2301890e4,cluster_id=4ce95e43-106c-427f-b260-49fdb2c8b034`

```
terraform import couchbase-capella_sample_bucket.new_sample_bucket id=YmVlci1zYW1wbGU=,organization_id=6af08c0a-8cab-4c2d-c957-b521585c16d0,project_id=c1fade1a-9f27-4a3c-ki90-g1b2301890e4,cluster_id=4ce95e43-106c-427f-b260-49fdb2c8b034

data.couchbase-capella_sample_buckets.existing_sample_buckets: Read complete after 2s

Import successful!

The resources that were imported are shown above. These resources are now in
your Terraform state and will henceforth be managed by Terraform.
```


Here, we pass the IDs as a single comma-separated string.
The first ID in the string is the sample bucket ID i.e. the ID of the resource that we want to import.
The second ID is the cluster ID i.e. the ID of the cluster to which the sample bucket belongs.
The third ID is the project ID i.e. the ID of the project to which the cluster belongs.
The fourth ID is the organization ID i.e. the ID of the organization to which the project belongs.

### Let's run a terraform plan to confirm that the import was successful and no resource states were impacted

Command: `terraform plan`

Sample Output:

```

No changes. Your infrastructure matches the configuration.

```

## UPDATE
### Let us edit the terraform.tfvars file to change the bucket configuration settings.

Sample buckets does not support update functionality. We can only change the sample bucket name which destroys the current sample bucket and creates a new one. 

Command: `terraform apply -var 'samplebucket={name="travel-sample"}'`

Sample Output:

```

 terraform apply -var 'samplebucket={name="travel-sample"}'

Note: Objects have changed outside of Terraform

Terraform detected the following changes made outside of Terraform since the last "terraform apply" which may have affected this plan:

  # couchbase-capella_sample_bucket.new_sample_bucket has changed
  ~ resource "couchbase-capella_sample_bucket" "new_sample_bucket" {
        id                         = "Z2FtZXNpbS1zYW1wbGU="

Unless you have made equivalent changes to your configuration, or ignored the relevant attributes using ignore_changes, the following plan may include actions to undo or respond to these changes.
