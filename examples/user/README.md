# Capella User Example

This example shows how to create and manage users in Capella.

This creates a new user in the selected Capella project. It uses the organization ID and projectId to do so.

An invitation email is triggered and sent to the user. Upon receiving the invitation email, the user is required to click on a provided URL, which will redirect them to a page with a user interface (UI) where they can set their username and password.

The modification of any personal information related to a user can only be performed by the user through the UI. Similarly, the user can solely conduct password updates through the UI.

The "caller" possessing Organization Owner access rights retains the exclusive user creation capability. They hold the authority to assign roles at the organization and project levels.

At present, our support is limited to the capella resourceType of "project" exclusively.

To run, configure your Couchbase Capella provider as described in README in the root of this project.

### List the resources that are present in the Terraform State file.

Command: 
```
terraform state list
```

Sample Output:
```
data.capella_users.existing_users
capella_user.new_user
```
### Remove the resource `new_user` from the Terraform State file

Command: `terraform state rm capella_user.new_user`

Sample Output:
```
Removed capella_user.new_user
Successfully removed 1 resource instance(s).
```

Please note, this command will only remove the resource from the Terraform State file, but in reality, the resource exists in Capella.
### Now, let's import the resource in Terraform
Command: `terraform import capella_user.new_user id=<user_id>,organization_id=<organization_id>`

In this case, the complete command is:
``
Sample Output:
```
var.user_email
  Email address of the user

  Enter a value: matty.maclean+2@couchbase.com

var.user_name
  Name of the user

  Enter a value: matty

capella_user.new_user: Importing from ID "id=47c321f7-571c-46bb-ac1f-146aa5aec314,organization_id=93f13778-3d11-43c5-861f-417a4b00ba81"...

data.capella_users.existing_users: Read complete after 0s

Import successful!

The resources that were imported are shown above. These resources are now in
your Terraform state and will henceforth be managed by Terraform.
```
### Let's run a terraform plan to confirm that the import was successful and no resource states were impacted
Command: 
```
terraform plan
```

Sample Output:

No changes. Your infrastructure matches the configuration.

Terraform has compared your real infrastructure against your configuration and found no differences, so no changes are needed.

### Finally, destroy the resources created by Terraform
Command: 
```
terraform destroy
```

Sample Output:

Do you really want to destroy all resources?
  Terraform will destroy all your managed infrastructure, as shown above.
  There is no undo. Only 'yes' will be accepted to confirm.

  Enter a value: yes
