# Capella API Keys Example

This example shows how to create and manage API Keys in Capella.

This creates a new apikey in the selected Capella cluster and lists existing apikeys in the cluster. It uses the organization ID to create and list apikeys.

To run, configure your Couchbase Capella provider as described in README in the root of this project.

# Example Walkthrough

In this example, we are going to do the following.

1. CREATE: Create a new apikey in Capella as stated in the `create_apikey.tf` file.
2. UPDATE: Update the apikey configuration using Terraform.
3. LIST: List existing apikeys in Capella as stated in the `list_apikeys.tf` file.
4. IMPORT: Import a apikey that exists in Capella but not in the terraform state file.
5. DELETE: Delete the newly created apikey from Capella.

If you check the `terraform.template.tfvars` file - Make sure you copy the file to `terraform.tfvars` and update the values of the variables as per the correct organization access.

## CREATE & LIST
### View the plan for the resources that Terraform will create

Command: `terraform plan`

Sample Output:

Note: You didn't use the -out option to save this plan, so Terraform can't guarantee to take exactly these actions if you run "terraform apply" now.

```


### Note the API Key ID for the new API Key
Command: `terraform output new_apikey`

Sample Output:
```
$ terraform output new_apikey
{
  "allowed_cidrs" = tolist([
    "10.1.42.0/23",
    "10.1.42.0/23",
  ])

    "version" = 1
  }
  "description" = ""
  "expiry" = 180
  "id" = "8KEJ9ODUQHcpskP5anBOFTzV8ZezWJaH"

      "roles" = tolist([
        "projectManager",

      "type" = "project"

  "rotate" = tonumber(null)

}
```


In this case, the apikey ID for my new apikey is `bmV3X3RlcnJhZm9ybV9idWNrZXQ=`

### List the resources that are present in the Terraform State file.

Command: `terraform state list`

Sample Output:
```
$ terraform state list
data.couchbase-capella_apikeys.existing_apikeys
couchbase-capella_apikey.new_apikey
```

## IMPORT
### Remove the resource `new_apikey` from the Terraform State file

Command: `terraform state rm couchbase-capella_apikey.new_apikey`

Sample Output:
```
$ terraform state rm couchbase-capella_apikey.new_apikey
Removed capella_apikey.new_apikey
Successfully removed 1 resource instance(s).
```

Please note, this command will only remove the resource from the Terraform State file, but in reality, the resource exists in Capella.

### Now, let's import the resource in Terraform

Command: `terraform import couchbase-capella_apikey.new_apikey id=<apikey_id>,cluster_id=<cluster_id>,project_id=<project_id>,organization_id=<organization_id>`

In this case, the complete command is:
`terraform import couchbase-capella_apikey.new_apikey id=bmV3X3RlcnJhZm9ybV9idWNrZXQ=,cluster_id=f499a9e6-e5a1-4f3e-95a7-941a41d046e6,project_id=958ad6b5-272d-49f0-babd-cc98c6b54a81,organization_id=0783f698-ac58-4018-84a3-31c3b6ef785d`

Sample Output:
```
$ terraform import couchbase-capella_apikey.new_apikey id=8KEJ9ODUQHcpskP5anBOFTzV8ZezWJaH,organization_id=0783f698-ac58-4018-84a3-31c3b6ef785d
capella_apikey.new_apikey: Importing from ID "id=8KEJ9ODUQHcpskP5anBOFTzV8ZezWJaH,organization_id=0783f698-ac58-4018-84a3-31c3b6ef785d"...

capella_apikey.new_apikey: Import prepared!

data.capella_apikeys.existing_apikeys: Read complete after 0s

Import successful!

The resources that were imported are shown above. These resources are now in
your Terraform state and will henceforth be managed by Terraform.
```

Here, we pass the IDs as a single comma-separated string.
The first ID in the string is the apikey ID i.e. the ID of the resource that we want to import.
The second ID is the cluster ID i.e. the ID of the cluster to which the apikey belongs.
The third ID is the project ID i.e. the ID of the project to which the cluster belongs.
The fourth ID is the organization ID i.e. the ID of the organization to which the project belongs.

### Let's run a terraform plan to confirm that the import was successful and no resource states were impacted

Command: `terraform plan`

Sample Output:
```
$ terraform plan
╷

│  - hashicorp.com/couchabasecloud/capella in /Users/talina.shrotriya/workspace/terraform-provider-capella

No changes. Your infrastructure matches the configuration.

Terraform has compared your real infrastructure against your configuration and found no differences, so no changes are needed.
```

## UPDATE
### Let us edit the terraform.tfvars file to change the apikey configuration settings.

Command: `terraform apply -var 'apikey={allowed_cidrs=["10.1.42.0/23", "10.1.43.0/23", "10.1.44.0/23"], name="New Terraform Api Key", description="A Capella Api Key", organization_roles = ["organizationMember"], expiry = 179}'`

Sample Output:
```
$ terraform apply -var 'apikey={allowed_cidrs=["10.1.42.0/23", "10.1.43.0/23", "10.1.44.0/23"], name="New Terraform Api Key", description="A Capella Api Key", organization_roles = ["organizationMember"], expiry             = 179}'

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:

Terraform will perform the following actions:
