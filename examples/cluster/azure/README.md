# Azure Cluster Example

This example shows how to create a Cluster on Azure, with autoexpansion enabled.

For autoexpansion it requires this disk variable in `terraform.template.tfvars`:

```
disk = {
  type = "P6"
  autoexpansion = true
}
```

It should be added to `variables.tf`:

```
type = object({
    size = optional(number)
    type = string
    iops = optional(number)
    autoexpansion = optional(bool)
  })
```

and referenced in `create_cluster.tf`:

```
disk = {
    type    = var.disk.type
    autoexpansion = var.disk.autoexpansion
}
```

Sample Output:

```
terraform apply -var-file terraform.template.tfvars

Terraform will perform the following actions:
