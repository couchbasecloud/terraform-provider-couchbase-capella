# Capella Cluster Example

This example shows how to create and manage Cluster in Capella.

This creates a new cluster in the selected Capella cluster and lists existing clusters in the cluster. It uses the project ID to create and list clusters.

To run, configure your Couchbase Capella provider as described in README in the root of this project.

# Example Walkthrough

In this example, we are going to do the following.

1. CREATE: Create a new cluster in Capella as stated in the `create_cluster.tf` file.
2. UPDATE: Update the cluster configuration using Terraform.
3. LIST: List existing clusters in Capella as stated in the `list_clusters.tf` file.
4. IMPORT: Import a cluster that exists in Capella but not in the terraform state file.
5. DELETE: Delete the newly created cluster from Capella.

If you check the `terraform.template.tfvars` file - Make sure you copy the file to `terraform.tfvars` and update the values of the variables as per the correct organization access.

## CREATE & LIST
### View the plan for the resources that Terraform will create

Command: `terraform plan`

Sample Output:
```
$ terraform plan

### Note the Bucket ID for the new Bucket
Command: `terraform output new_cluster`

Sample Output:
```
$ terraform output new_cluster
{
  "app_service_id" = tostring(null)
  "audit" = {
    "created_at" = "2023-10-04 19:30:24.442533243 +0000 UTC"
    "created_by" = "FYcHU0XHvw5tuQl4smAwyCKbGPMUZKUC"
    "modified_at" = "2023-10-04 19:33:26.507037621 +0000 UTC"
    "modified_by" = "FYcHU0XHvw5tuQl4smAwyCKbGPMUZKUC"
    "version" = 5
  }
  "availability" = {
    "type" = "multi"
  }
  "cloud_provider" = {
    "cidr" = "192.168.0.0/20"
    "region" = "us-east-1"
    "type" = "aws"
  }
  "couchbase_server" = {
    "version" = "7.1"
  }
  "current_state" = "healthy"
  "description" = "My first test cluster for multiple services."
  "etag" = "Version: 5"
  "id" = "f90c1d8a-c01f-4faa-860d-71cdcdf454f6"
  "if_match" = tostring(null)
  "name" = "New Terraform Cluster"
  "organization_id" = "0783f698-ac58-4018-84a3-31c3b6ef785d"
  "project_id" = "958ad6b5-272d-49f0-babd-cc98c6b54a81"
  "service_groups" = tolist([
    {
      "node" = {
        "compute" = {
          "cpu" = 4
          "ram" = 16
        }
        "disk" = {
          "iops" = 5000
          "storage" = 50
          "type" = "io2"
        }
      }
      "num_of_nodes" = 3
      "services" = tolist([
        "data",
        "index",
        "query",
      ])
    },
  ])
  "support" = {
    "plan" = "developer pro"
    "timezone" = "PT"
  }
}
```


In this case, the cluster ID for my new cluster is `f90c1d8a-c01f-4faa-860d-71cdcdf454f6`

### List the resources that are present in the Terraform State file.

Command: `terraform state list`

Sample Output:
```
$ terraform state list
data.couchbase-capella_clusters.existing_clusters
couchbase-capella_cluster.new_cluster
```

## IMPORT
### Remove the resource `new_cluster` from the Terraform State file

Command: `terraform state rm couchbase-capella_cluster.new_cluster`

Sample Output:
```
$ terraform state rm couchbase-capella_cluster.new_cluster
Removed couchbase-capella_cluster.new_cluster
Successfully removed 1 resource instance(s).
```

Please note, this command will only remove the resource from the Terraform State file, but in reality, the resource exists in Capella.

### Now, let's import the resource in Terraform

Command: `terraform import couchbase-capella_cluster.new_cluster id=<cluster_id>,cluster_id=<cluster_id>,project_id=<project_id>,organization_id=<organization_id>`

In this case, the complete command is:
`terraform import couchbase-capella_cluster.new_cluster id=f90c1d8a-c01f-4faa-860d-71cdcdf454f6,project_id=958ad6b5-272d-49f0-babd-cc98c6b54a81,organization_id=0783f698-ac58-4018-84a3-31c3b6ef785d`

Sample Output:
```
$ terraform import couchbase-capella_cluster.new_cluster id=f90c1d8a-c01f-4faa-860d-71cdcdf454f6,project_id=958ad6b5-272d-49f0-babd-cc98c6b54a81,organization_id=0783f698-ac58-4018-84a3-31c3b6ef785d

data.capella_clusters.existing_clusters: Read complete after 1s

Import successful!

The resources that were imported are shown above. These resources are now in
your Terraform state and will henceforth be managed by Terraform.
```

Here, we pass the IDs as a single comma-separated string.
The first ID in the string is the cluster ID i.e. the ID of the resource that we want to import.
The second ID is the project ID i.e. the ID of the project to which the cluster belongs.
The third ID is the organization ID i.e. the ID of the organization to which the project belongs.


## UPDATE
### Let us edit the terraform.tfvars file to change the cluster configuration settings.

Command: `terraform apply -var 'support={plan="enterprise", timezone="IST"}'`

Sample Output:
```
$ terraform apply -var 'support={plan="enterprise", timezone="IST"}'
╷
│ Warning: Provider development overrides are in effect
│ 
│ The following provider development overrides are set in the CLI configuration:
│  - hashicorp.com/couchbasecloud/capella in /Users/$USER/workspace/terraform-provider-capella

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  ~ update in-place
