# List Existin Project Level Cloud Snapshot Backups

This example shows how to list cloud snapshot backups that already exist in Capella for a given cluster. It uses the organization ID and project ID to do so. 

To run, configure your Couchbase Capella provider as described in README in the root of this project.
