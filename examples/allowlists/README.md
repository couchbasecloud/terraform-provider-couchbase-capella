# Capella AllowList Example

This example shows how to create and manage AllowLists in Capella.

This creates a new allowlist in the selected Capella cluster. It uses the organization ID, projectId and clusterId to do so.

To run, configure your Couchbase Capella provider as described in README in the root of this project.

# Example Walkthrough

In this example, we are going to do the following.

1. Create a new allowlist entry in an existing Capella cluster as stated in the `create_allowlist.tf` file.

### View the plan for the resources that Terraform will create

Command: `terraform plan`

Sample Output:
```
$ terraform plan
╷
│ Warning: Provider development overrides are in effect
│ 
│ The following provider development overrides are set in the CLI configuration:
│  - hashicorp.com/couchabasecloud/capella in /Users/talina.shrotriya/workspace/terraform-provider-capella
│ 
│ The behavior may therefore not match any released version of the provider and applying changes may cause the state to become incompatible with published releases.
╵

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # capella_allowlist.new_allowlist will be created

Note: You didn't use the -out option to save this plan, so Terraform can't guarantee to take exactly these actions if you run "terraform apply" now.
```

### Apply the Plan, in order to create a new Allowlist entry

Command: `terraform apply`

Sample Output:
```
$ terraform apply
╷

│ 
│ The following provider development overrides are set in the CLI configuration:
│  - hashicorp.com/couchabasecloud/capella in /Users/talina.shrotriya/workspace/terraform-provider-capella
