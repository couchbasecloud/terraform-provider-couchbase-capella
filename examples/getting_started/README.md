# End to End Demo for Private Preview

In this demo, we will perform the following operations:

1. Fetch organization details based on the `organization_id`
2. Create a new API Key in the organization.
3. Invite a new user to the organization.
4. Create a new project in the organization.
5. Create a new AWS cluster in the organization and the newly created project.
6. Store the cluster certificate in an output variable.
7. Create a new database credential in the newly created cluster.
8. Add a new allowlist to the cluster.
9. Create a new bucket in the cluster.
10. Create a new sample bucket in the cluster.
11. Create a new app service in the cluster.
12. Create an app endpoint in the created app service.
13. Configure an access control function in the app endpoint.
14. Configure an import filter in the app endpoint.
15. Configure an OIDC provider on the app endpoint.
16. Configure a CORS policy on the app endpoint.
17. Change the app endpoint's activation status.
18. Create a new scope in the bucket of the cluster.
19. Create a new collection in the scope of a bucket.
20. Create a new on/off schedule for the cluster.
21. Create a new audit log settings.
22. Enable private endpoint service on the cluster.
23. Create a new network peer.
24. Create an non-deferred secondary index.

## Pre-Requisites:

Make sure you have followed the pre-requisite steps from the parent readme that builds the binary and stores the path in a .terraformrc file.

### Variables file

- Copy the `terraform.template.tfvars` file to `terraform.tfvars` file in the same directory
- Create 1 V4 API key in your organization using the Capella UI.
- Replace all placeholders with actual values. 
- Set the auth token as an environment variable:

```
export TF_VAR_auth_token='<v4-api-key-secret>'
```

## Execution

Command: `terraform plan`

Sample Output:
```
terraform plan
