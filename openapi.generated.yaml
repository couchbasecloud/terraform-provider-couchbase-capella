  title: Couchbase Capella Management API
  version: v4.0
  description: |
    The Couchbase Capella Management API provides a set of REST APIs for creating and managing Capella instances.
    It enables users to perform operations such as creating new Capella instances, managing their configurations, and interacting with the Capella services.
    This API documentation specifies the endpoints, request and response formats, and authentication requirements for seamless integration with Couchbase Capella.

    To access the Management API, you need an API key.
    To create an initial bootstrap API key you must use the Capella UI.
    Once you have created an initial bootstrap API key, you can use the Management API itself to create further API keys.
    To learn more, see [Get Started with the Management API v4.0](https://docs.couchbase.com/cloud/management-api-guide/management-api-start.html).

    For a history of updates to the Management API, see [Management API v4.0 Change Log](https://docs.couchbase.com/cloud/management-api-guide/management-api-log.html).

    **API Base URL:**

      summary: Create User
      description: |
        Invites a new user under the organization.

        After making a REST API request, an invitation email is triggered and sent to the user.
        Upon receiving the invitation email, the user is required to click on a provided URL, which will redirect them to a page with a user interface (UI) where they can set their username and password.

        The modification of any personal information related to a user can only be performed by the user through the UI.
        Similarly, the user can solely conduct password updates through the UI.

        The "caller" possessing Organization Owner access rights retains the exclusive user creation capability.
        They hold the authority to assign roles at the organization and project levels.

        At present, our support is limited to the resourceType of "project" exclusively.

        In order to access this endpoint, the provided API key must have the following role:
        - Organization Owner

        To learn more, see [Organization Roles](https://docs.couchbase.com/cloud/organizations/organization-user-roles.html).

      description: |
        Lists all the users in the organization and filter on the basis of projectId.

        In order to access this endpoint, the provided API key must have at least one of the following roles:
        - Organization Owner
        - Organization Member
        - Project Creator

        The results are always limited by the role and scope of the caller's privileges.

        When retrieving a list of users through a GET request, if a user holds the organization owner role, the response will exclude project-level permissions for those users. This is because organization owners have full access to all resources within the organization, making project-level permissions irrelevant for them.

        To learn more about the roles, see [Organization Roles](https://docs.couchbase.com/cloud/organizations/organization-user-roles.html) and [Project Roles](https://docs.couchbase.com/cloud/projects/project-roles.html).

        - Project Owner

        An Organization Owner API key can be utilized to update organizational-level roles and project-level roles for all projects within the organization.

        The Project Owner API key allows for updating project-level roles, solely within the projects where the API key holds the Project Owner role.

        The modification of any personal information related to a user, such as password updates, can only be performed by the respective user through the user interface (UI).

        The results are always limited by the role and scope of the caller's privileges.
        To learn more about the roles, see [Organization Roles](https://docs.couchbase.com/cloud/organizations/organization-user-roles.html) and [Project Roles](https://docs.couchbase.com/cloud/projects/project-roles.html).

        Turn App Service off.

        Turn off an App Service to temporarily deactivate it and reduce its consumption of compute resources.
        The App Service itself and its related infrastructure will be removed once turned off.

        Any private endpoints configured on App Services will remain and will be available when App Service is turned back
        on. You will continue to incur costs for any private endpoints configured on App Services.  If you don’t wish to
        incur these costs, you must explicitly disable private endpoint service and reinstate private endpoints when App
        Service is turned back on again.

        Free tier App Service can only be turned off when the linked free tier cluster is turned off.

        The following features are not available for free tier buckets:
          - bucket flush 
          - migrate to another storage engine like magma

        Note that you can only create a free tier bucket on a free tier cluster.

      summary: Migrate Buckets
      description: |
        Updates the storage backend of an existing bucket from Couchstore to Magma.

        The following should be noted while doing this operation -

        1. The outcome of this migration is that all data service nodes in the cluster will be replaced.
        - During the migration all buckets will remain operational and still be able to perform read and writes. Hence applications will not incur any downtime during this migration and can continue to read/write to the cluster.
        - The re-balances that occur from the node replacements will result in the bucket(s) being migrated to Magma.
        - The status of the cluster can be monitored via the [GET cluster API](https://docs.couchbase.com/cloud/management-api-reference/index.html#tag/clusters/operation/getCluster). The cluster will transition to healthy state after migration is completed for all listed buckets.

        2. This operation is only allowed for clusters with server version >= 7.6.0. The storage backend cannot be updated for the cluster with server versions lower than this. All the nodes must be upgraded to 7.6.0 before the bucket migration can be performed.

        3. Before migrating from Couchstore to Magma, the bucket memory allocation should be upgraded to at least the minimum amount required for a Magma bucket that is 1024 MiB.

        4. Cluster must be in a healthy state to perform this operation.

      description: |
        Creates a restore job for a backup immediately.

        When multiple cross-regional cloud snapshots are available, a region of preference can be specified within the
        request payload to ensure optimal recovery in scenarios where the original snapshot in the cluster’s primary
        region is not restorable. In such cases, cross-regional copies serve as a reliable fallback to maintain data
        availability and minimize downtime. Selecting the geographically closest cross-regional snapshot among the
        available options helps reduce latency during data retrieval and significantly lowers data transfer costs due
        to shorter network paths.

        If no preferred region order is specified, the system automatically selects the most suitable snapshot
        based on availability.

        Currently, only the `tags` filter is multi-valued; all other filters are single-valued.

        By default, `to` is set to the request time, and `from` is set to 24 hours before the
        request time. If 'to' is set and 'from' is not set, then 'from' is set to 24 hours
        before 'to'.

      summary: Get Azure VNET Peering CLI Command
      description: |
        Retrieves the role assignment command or script to be executed in the Azure CLI to assign a new network contributor role. It scopes only to the specified subscription and the virtual network within that subscription.

        - Before using this API, please make sure that the *Admin consent granting* process has been completed through the Capella UI.
        - This process to grant consent to the VNET peering service principal in the external Azure tenant needs to be done only once for the organization i.e. the first time when the VNET peering is created.
        - Consenting to this permission request creates a service principal that grants Capella access to the Azure tenant to perform VNET peering.
        - To complete the admin consent granting process, the Organization owner should follow the steps below -
            1. Login to the Capella UI.
            2. Deploy an Azure Cluster or open an existing one you want to peer with your application.
            3. Click the Settings tab, in the navigation pane click VNET Peering.
            4. Click Setup VNET Peering.
            5. Confirm that you have a user with the Global Administrator Role.
            6. Add the Azure configuration details to allow peering access.
            7. Click Allow Peering Access - A new browser tab opens. Sign in to Azure if you have not already.
            8. In Azure, accept Capella’s permissions request - The Azure permissions request page is open in the new browser tab and consent to the new permissions request.
              For more information refer [docs]- https://docs.couchbase.com/cloud/clouds/vpc-peering/peer-azure.html
        - On accepting the new permission, you automatically return to the Capella VNET peering page. The Capella VNET peering page shows a notice indicating that peering access is successful.

        - The Organization Owner should set this up once, then for network peering, use the public API -
            1. Use this `Get Azure VNET Peering CLI Command` API to fetch the command.
            2. Run the role assignment command in the Azure CLI.
            3. Use the `Create VPC Peering` API to create the network peering.

        To learn more about indexes please refer to the [documentation](https://docs.couchbase.com/server/current/learn/services-and-indexes/indexes/indexing-and-query-perf.html).

        It is recommended to use deferred index builds, especially for larger indexes. 
        When creating indexes in bulk, we do not recommend sending requests to create all of them at once. 
        Instead, we strongly recommend creating indexes in batches of 100 or less.

        Update the configuration of an existing replication.

        **Update Behavior**:

        Only fields included in the request body will be updated. Omitted fields remain unchanged.

        **Note on Mappings**:

        When updating the mappings, you have three options:

        - **Keep current settings**: Omit the `mappings` field & `allScopes` field entirely
        - **Set explicit mappings**: Include `mappings` array with scope and/or collection definitions
        - **Replicate full bucket**: Include `allScopes: true` instead of mappings

        You cannot specify both `mappings` and `allScopes: true` in the same request.

        **Note on Filter Expression Updates**:

        When the `filter.expressions.regEx` value is updated, the user must explicitly set `filter.expressions.skipRestream` to indicate the desired behavior:

        - If `skipRestream` is `false` (default), the replication will be saved and restarted to apply the new filter expression to all data.
        - If `skipRestream` is `true`, the new filter expression will apply **only to new mutations**, and the replication will not be restarted.

      summary: Disassociate Data API Private Endpoint
      description: |
        Removes or disassociates the private endpoint. If the private endpoint connection has still not yet been accepted, the request is rejected.
        Turning off the cluster will not automatically remove any of the Data API Endpoints and the endpoints will be available when cluster is turned back on. If you remove the private endpoint before turning off a cluster, you must associate it back again with data api is turned back on.
        Retaining private endpoints when cluster is off does not result in any additional charges beyond the cost of enabling Data API.

        In order to access this endpoint, the provided API key must have at least one of the following roles:
        - Organization Owner
        - Project Owner

For example, suppose you specify san.uri as a path in the certificate to use, and set the prefix to www.. If Couchbase Server extracts the value www.example.com from the san.uri element in the certificate, the prefix matches leading www., leaving Couchbase Server with example.com as the username.

For example, suppose you specify san.email as a path in the certificate, and set the delimeter to @. If Couchbase Server extracts the value john.smit@example.com as the value of san.email, it splits the value at the @, leaving it with john.smith to match to a username.'

          - If the schedule is a non-custom day - with state `on` or `off`, it cannot contain a time boundary.
          - If the schedule is a `custom` day -
              - It should contain the `from` time boundary. If the `to` time boundary is not specified then the default value of 0 hour 0 minute is set and the cluster will be turned on for the entire day from the time set in `from` time boundary.
              - Time boundary should have a valid `hour` value. The valid hour values are from 0 to 23 inclusive.
              - Time boundary should have a valid `minute` value. The valid minute values are 0 and 30.
              - The `from` time boundary should not be later than the `to` time boundary.
              - If the `hour` and `minute` values are not provided for the time boundaries, it is set to a default value of 0 for both. (0 hour 0 minute)
