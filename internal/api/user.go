// CreateUserRequest is the request payload sent to the Capella V4 Public API when asked to invite a new user to an organization.
// This request simply invites a new user under the organization.
// An invitation email is triggered and sent to the user.
// Upon receiving the invitation email, the user is required to click on a provided URL,
// which will redirect them to a page with a user interface (UI) where they can set their username and password.
//
// The modification of any personal information related to a user can only be performed by the user through the UI.
// Similarly, the user can solely conduct password updates through the UI.
//
// The "caller" possessing Organization Owner access rights retains the exclusive user creation capability.
// They hold the authority to assign roles at the organization and project levels.
// At present, our support is limited to the resourceType of "project" exclusively.
//
// In order to access this endpoint, the provided API key must have the following role:
// Organization Owner
// To learn more, see https://docs.couchbase.com/cloud/organizations/organization-user-roles.html

// Organization Owner

// Project Creator
// The results are always limited by the role and scope of the caller's privileges.

// the response will exclude project-level permissions for that user.
// This is because organization owners have access to all resources at the organization level, rendering project-level permissions unnecessary for them.
