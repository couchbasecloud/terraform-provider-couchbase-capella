type CreateBucketRequest struct {
	// Name is the name of the bucket (up to 100 characters).
	// This field cannot be changed later. The name should be according to the following rules:
	// Characters used for the name should be in the ranges of A-Z, a-z, and 0-9; plus the underscore, period, dash, and percent characters.

	// Enum: "couchstore" "magma"
	// Ephemeral buckets do not support StorageBackend, hence not applicable for Ephemeral buckets and throws an error if this field is added.
	// This field is only applicable for a Couchbase bucket. The default value mentioned (Couchstore) is for Couchbase bucket.

	// Default: 100
	// This is the maximum limit is dependent on the allocation of the KV service. For example, 80% of the allocation.
	//
	// The default value (100MiB) mentioned is for Couchbase type buckets with Couchstore as the Storage Backend.
	//
	// For Couchbase buckets, the default and minimum memory allocation changes according to the Storage Backend type as follows:
	// For Couchstore, the default and minimum memory allocation is 100 MiB.

	// This field may be referred to as "conflict resolution" in the Couchbase documentation, and seqno and lww may be
	// referred to as "sequence number" and "timestamp" respectively.

	// This field cannot be changed later.

	// Default: "none"
	// Enum: "none" "majority" "majorityAndPersistActive" "persistToMajority"

	// The options for Durability level are as follows, according to the bucket type.
	//
	// For a Couchbase bucket:
	// None
	// Replicate to Majority
	// Majority and Persist to Active
	// Persist to Majority
	//
	// For an Ephemeral bucket:

	// To learn more, see https://docs.couchbase.com/cloud/clusters/data-service/manage-buckets.html#add-bucket
	Replicas *int64 `json:"replicas"`

	// Flush determines whether flushing is enabled on the bucket.
	// Default: false
	// Enable Flush to delete all items in this bucket at the earliest opportunity.
	// Disable Flush to avoid inadvertent data loss.
	Flush *bool `json:"flush"`

	// TimeToLiveInSeconds specifies the time to live (TTL) value in seconds.
	// Default: 0
	// This is the maximum time to live for items in the bucket.
	// Default is 0, that means TTL is disabled. This is a non-negative value.
	TimeToLiveInSeconds *int64 `json:"timeToLiveInSeconds"`

	// EvictionPolicy is the policy which Capella adopts to prevent data loss due to memory exhaustion.
	// This may be also known as Ejection Policy in the Couchbase documentation.
	//
	// Default: "fullEviction"
	// Enum: "fullEviction" "noEviction" "nruEviction"
	//
	// For Couchbase bucket, Eviction Policy is fullEviction by default.
	// For Ephemeral buckets, Eviction Policy is a required field, and should be one of the following:
