# Terraform Provider Capella 

This is the repository for Couchbase's Terraform-Provider-Capella which forms a Terraform plugin for use with Couchbase Capella.

## Requirements

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) >= 1.5.2
- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) >= 1.21

### Environment

- We use Go Modules to manage dependencies, so you can develop outside your `$GOPATH`.
- We use [golangci-lint](https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint) to lint our code, you can install it locally via `make setup`.

## Using the Provider

### Building
- Enter the provider directory
- Run `make setup` to install the needed tools for the provider.
- Run `make build` to build the binary in the `./bin` directory.
- Use the local provider binary in the `./bin` folder.
- Create the following `dev.terraformrc` file inside your directory

Terraform installs providers and verifies their versions and checksums when you run `terraform init`. Terraform will download your
providers from either the provider registry or a local registry. However, while building your provider you will want to
test a Terraform configuration against a local development build of the provider. The development build will not have an associated
version number or an official set of checksums listed in a provider registry.

Terraform allows you to use local provider builds by setting a dev_overrides block in a configuration file with ext .terraformrc or .tfrc.

This block overrides all other configured installation methods.

Terraform searches for the .terraformrc or .tfrc file in your home directory and applies any configuration settings you set.

  ```terraform
  provider_installation {

    dev_overrides {
      "hashicorp.com/couchabasecloud/couchbase-capella" = "<PATH>"
    }

    # For all other providers, install them directly from their origin provider
    # registries as normal. If you omit this, Terraform will _only_ use
    # the dev_overrides block, and so no other providers will be available.
    direct {}
  }
  ```

- Define the env var `TF_CLI_CONFIG_FILE` in your console session

  ```bash
  export TF_CLI_CONFIG_FILE=PATH/TO/dev.terraformrc
  ```
- Run `terraform init` to initialize terraform
- Run `terraform apply` to use terraform with the local binary

For more explained information about plugin override check [Development Overrides for Provider Developers](https://www.terraform.io/docs/cli/config/config-file.html#development-overrides-for-provider-developers)

### Authentication

In order to set up authentication with the Couchbase Capella provider a V4 API key must be generated. 

To find out how to generate a V4 API Key, please see the following document: 
https://docs.couchbase.com/cloud/management-api-guide/management-api-start.html

### Terraform Environment Variables

Environment variables can be set by terraform by creating and adding terraform.template.tfvars
```terraform
auth_token = "<v4-api-key-secret>"
organization_id = "<organization-uuid>"
# This env variable is optional and allow you to run terraform with a custom API server.
host = "https://cloudapi.cloud.couchbase.com"
```

A variables.tf should also be added to define the variables for terraform. 
```terraform
variable "host" {
  description = "The Host URL of Couchbase Cloud."
}

variable "organization_id" {
  description = "Capella Organization ID"
}

variable "auth_token" {
  description = "Authentication API Key"
}
```

Set the environment variables by using the following notation: 
```terraform
resource "capella_project" "example" {
  organization_id = var.organization_id
  name = var.project_name
  description = "A Capella Project that will host many Capella clusters."
}
```

Alternatively, if you would like to set environment variables locally on your system (as opposed to using terraform.template.tfvars),
preface them with `TF_VAR_`. Terraform will then apply them your .terraformrc file on running
`terraform apply`. For example: 
```bash
export TF_VAR_auth_token=<v4_api_secret_key>
export TF_VAR_organization_id=<organization_id>
# This env variable is optional and allow you to run terraform with a custom API server.
export TF_VAR_host= "https://cloudapi.cloud.couchbase.com"
```

### Create and manage resources using terraform

#### Example Usage

Note: You will need to provide both the url of the capella host as well as your V4 API secret for authentication. 

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    couchbase-capella = {
      source = "hashicorp.com/couchabasecloud/couchbase-capella"
    }
  }
}

provider "couchbase-capella" {
  host     = "the host url of couchbase cloud"
  authentication_token = "capella authentication token"
}


resource "capella_project" "example" {
  organization_id = "ffffffff-aaaa-1414-eeee-000000000000"
  name = "example-name"
  description = "example-description"
}

output "example_project" {
  value = capella_project.example
}
```

This repository contains a number of example directories containing examples of Hashicorp Configuration Language (HCL) code 
being used to create and manage Capella resources. To try these examples out for yourself, change into one of them and run
the below commands.

#### Commands

#### Terraform Init

Ordinarily, terraform will downloaded the requested providers on running the command: 
```bash
$ terraform init
```
If you are working with a local install of `Terraform-Provider-Couchbase-Capella` provider, this step is not needed and considered optional. 
However if you plan to use any other providers at the same time it may need to be ran. 

**1\. Review the Terraform plan**

Execute the following command to automatically review and update the formatting of .tf files.
```bash
$ terraform fmt
```

The terraform.template.tfvars defines a template on how the variable values should be added. 
Copy this file as `terraform.tfvars` in the same directory and add the value for each variable.

Execute the following command to review the resources that will be deployed.

```bash
$ terraform plan
```

**2\. Execute the Terraform apply**

Execute the plan to deploy the Couchbase Capella resources.

```bash
$ terraform apply
```

**3\. Destroy the resources**

Execute the following command to destroy all the resources.

```bash
$ terraform destroy
```

To destroy specific resource

```bash
$ terraform destroy -target=RESOURCE_ADDRESS
```
Example

```bash
$ terraform destroy -target=capella_project.example
```

**4\. To refresh the state file to sync with the remote**

```bash
$ terraform apply --refresh-only
```

**5\. To import remote resource**

```bash
$ terraform import RESOURCE_TYPE.NAME RESOURCE_IDENTIFIER
```

### Running the acceptance test

~> **Notice:** Acceptance tests create real resources, and often cost money to run. Please note in any PRs made if you are unable to pay to run acceptance tests for your contribution. We will accept "best effort" implementations of acceptance tests in this case and run them for you on our side. This may delay the contribution but we do not want your contribution blocked by funding.
- Run `make testacc`

## Discovering New API features

Most of the new features of the provider are using [capella-public-apis](https://docs.couchbase.com/cloud/management-api-guide/management-api-intro.html)
Public APIs are updated automatically, tracking all new Capella features.
