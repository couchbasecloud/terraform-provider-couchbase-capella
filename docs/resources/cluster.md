# couchbase-capella_cluster (Resource)

Manages the Couchbase Capella cluster resource.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "couchbase-capella_cluster" "new_cluster" {
  organization_id = "<organization_id>"
  project_id      = "<project_id>"
  name            = "Terraform Test Cluster"
  description     = "Test cluster created with Terraform"
  cloud_provider = {
    type   = "aws"
    region = "us-east-1"
    cidr   = "10.200.250.0/23"
  }
  couchbase_server = {
    version = "7.6"
  }
  service_groups = [
    {
      node = {
        compute = {
          cpu = 4
          ram = 16
        }
        disk = {
          storage = 50
          type    = "io2"
          iops    = 5000
        }
      }
      num_of_nodes = 3
      services     = ["data", "index", "query"]
    }
  ]
  availability = {
    "type" : "multi"
  }
  support = {
    plan     = "enterprise"

## Schema

### Required

- `availability` (Attributes) Availability configuration for the cluster. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--availability))
- `cloud_provider` (Attributes) The cloud provider where the cluster will be hosted. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--cloud_provider))
- `name` (String) The name of the cluster (up to 256 characters).
- `organization_id` (String) The ID of the organization that the cluster and project belongs to.
- `project_id` (String) The ID of the project that the cluster belongs to.
- `service_groups` (Attributes Set) Configuration for the service groups in the cluster. Each service group represents a set of nodes with the same configuration. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--service_groups))
- `support` (Attributes) Support configuration for the cluster. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--support))

### Optional

- `configuration_type` (String, Deprecated) The configuration type of the cluster. This field is deprecated.
- `couchbase_server` (Attributes) Configuration for the Couchbase Server running on the cluster. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--couchbase_server))
- `description` (String) Description of the cluster (up to 1024 characters).
- `enable_private_dns_resolution` (Boolean) EnablePrivateDNSResolution signals that the cluster should have hostnames that are hosted in a public DNS zone that resolve to a private DNS address. This exists to support the use case of customers connecting from their own data centers where it is not possible to make use of a cloud service provider DNS zone.
- `if_match` (String) The If-Match header value used for optimistic concurrency control.
- `zones` (Set of String) Zones is the cloud services provider availability zones for the cluster. Currently Supported only for single AZ clusters so only 1 zone is allowed in list.

### Read-Only

- `app_service_id` (String) The ID of the App Service associated with this cluster.
- `audit` (Attributes) Couchbase audit data. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--audit))
- `connection_string` (String) The connection string to use to connect to the cluster.
- `current_state` (String) The current state of the cluster.
- `etag` (String) The ETag header value returned by the server, used for optimistic concurrency control.
- `id` (String) The ID of the Capella cluster.
