# couchbase-capella_cluster_onoff_schedule (Resource)

The On/Off schedule resource allows you to manage the on/off schedule for a Capella cluster.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "couchbase-capella_cluster_onoff_schedule" "new_cluster_onoff_schedule" {
  organization_id = "aaaaaa-bbbbb-cccc-dddd-eeeeeeeeeeee"
  project_id      = "aaaaaa-bbbbb-cccc-dddd-eeeeeeeeeeee"
  cluster_id      = "aaaaaa-bbbbb-cccc-dddd-eeeeeeeeeeee"
  timezone        = "US/Hawaii"
  days = [
    {
      day   = "monday"
      state = "custom"
      from = {
        hour   = 12
        minute = 30
      }
      to = {
        hour   = 14
        minute = 30
      }
    },
    {
      day   = "tuesday"
      state = "custom"
      from = {
        hour = 12
      }
      to = {
        hour   = 19
        minute = 30
      }
    },
    {
      day   = "wednesday"
      state = "on"
    },
    {
      day   = "thursday"
