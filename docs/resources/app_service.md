# couchbase-capella_app_service (Resource)

This resource allows you to create and manage an App Service in Capella. App Service is a fully managed application backend designed to provide data synchronization between mobile or IoT applications running Couchbase Lite and your Couchbase Capella database.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "couchbase-capella_app_service" "new_app_service" {
  organization_id = "<organization_id>"
  project_id      = "<project_id>"
  cluster_id      = "<cluster_id>"
  name            = "MyAppSyncService"
  description     = "My app sync service."
  nodes           = 2
  compute = {
    cpu = 2
    ram = 4
  }
}
```
