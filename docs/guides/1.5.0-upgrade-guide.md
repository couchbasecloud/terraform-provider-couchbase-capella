## Changes

There are no deprecations as part of this release.

1.5.0 includes new free tier resources, documentation and general improvements, and bug fixes. For more information, see the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/couchbasecloud/terraform-provider-couchbase-capella/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

## Free Tier Cluster

Use the new `free_tier_cluster` resource to create and manage a free tier operational cluster. This is a Single Node cluster that runs only the Data, Query, Index and Search Services. Only 1 free tier operational cluster is available per organization.

```
resource "couchbase-capella_free_tier_cluster" "new_free_tier_cluster" {
  organization_id = var.organization_id
  project_id      = var.project_id
  name            = "New free tier cluster"
  description     = "New free tier test cluster for multiple services"
  cloud_provider = {
    type   = "aws"
    region = "us-east-2"
    cidr   = "10.1.0.0/16"
  }
}
```

For more information, see the [free tier cluster examples](https://github.com/couchbasecloud/terraform-provider-couchbase-capella/tree/main/examples/free_tier_cluster).

## Free Tier Bucket

Use the new `free_tier_bucket` resource to create and manage buckets within a free tier operational cluster. This is a Couchbase bucket where only the name and memory quota is configurable. Other bucket properties use default values.

```
resource "couchbase-capella_free_tier_bucket" "new_free_tier_bucket" {
  organization_id         = var.organization_id
  project_id             = var.project_id
  cluster_id             = var.cluster_id
  name                   = "test_bucket"
  memory_allocation_in_mb = 250
}
```

For more information, see the [free tier bucket examples](https://github.com/couchbasecloud/terraform-provider-couchbase-capella/tree/main/examples/free_tier_bucket).

## Free Tier App Service

Use the new `free_tier_app_service` resource to set up and manage App Services for your free tier operational cluster. This is a Single Node App Service that can only be linked to a free tier operational cluster. You can only turn on or off the App Service when the linked free tier cluster is also turned on or off.

```
resource "couchbase-capella_free_tier_app_service" "new_free_tier_app_service" {
  organization_id = var.organization_id
  project_id      = var.project_id
  cluster_id      = var.cluster_id
  name            = "free-tier-app-service"
  description     = "Free Tier App Service created by terraform"
}
```

For more information, see the [free tier App Service examples](https://github.com/couchbasecloud/terraform-provider-couchbase-capella/tree/main/examples/free_tier_appservice).

## Free Tier Cluster On/Off

Use the new `free_tier_cluster_on_off` resource to turn your free tier operational cluster on or off as needed. When you turn your free tier cluster on or off, any linked App Service will be turned on or off as well.

```
resource "couchbase-capella_free_tier_cluster_on_off" "new_free_tier_cluster_on_off" {
  organization_id = var.organization_id
  project_id      = var.project_id
  cluster_id      = var.cluster_id
  state           = "on"
}
```

For more information, see the [free tier cluster on/off examples](https://github.com/couchbasecloud/terraform-provider-couchbase-capella/tree/main/examples/free_tier_cluster_on_off).
