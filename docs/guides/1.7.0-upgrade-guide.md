# Couchbase Capella Provider 1.7.0: Upgrade and Information Guide

Here is a list of what's new in 1.7.0

## New Features

* Prevent Attempts to Restore a Snapshot Backup before it is Created
* `retention` and `interval` should be computed for the Cloud Snapshot Backup Schedule data source
* Enforces the limit on regions_to_copy, so a maximum of two can be selected
* Makes the comments in `terraform
* This allows the user to manage cloud snapshot backups, and cloud snapshot backup schedules as resources
* Remove the deprecated WithDescription function from the feature branch

## Bug Fixes

* The GSI datasource schema has been reverted to its original state
* The number of replicas cannot be set to zero, so we have added a validation check for this
* Fix num-replicas zero value not getting populated
* We are reverting the GSI monitor schema to its original state, as the changes were introduced unintentionally
* Sets default values for the optional variables to prevent the user being requested to enter values for the optional variables, even if they are not using them
* Terraform import fix for null pointer exception during gsi index imports
For more info please refer CBSE:- https://jira
* The aim of this PR is to properly ensure that we are not unintentionally setting default values for optional fields that already have non-zero defaults on the server side
* Change `snapshot_backup` to `cloud_snapshot_backup` in `terraform
