# Couchbase Capella Provider 1.1.0: Upgrade and Information Guide

We are pleased to announce the new release for Couchbase Capella's Terraform Provider - v1.1.0
There are a number of new features included in this release.

New Features:

* You can now import sample datasets into buckets with [`couchbase-capella_sample_bucket`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/couchbasecloud/couchbase-capella/latest/docs/resources/sample_bucket).
* You can now create and manage scopes in buckets with [`couchbase-capella_scope`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/couchbasecloud/couchbase-capella/latest/docs/resources/scope)
* You can now create multiple collections in a scope and manage the collections with [`couchbase-capella_collection`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/couchbasecloud/couchbase-capella/latest/docs/resources/collection)
* You can now turn off your cluster on demand with [`couchbase-capella_cluster_onoff_ondemand`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/couchbasecloud/couchbase-capella/latest/docs/resources/cluster_onoff_ondemand)
* You can now turn off your app service on demand with [`couchbase-capella_app_service_onoff_ondemand`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/couchbasecloud/couchbase-capella/latest/docs/resources/app_service_onoff_ondemand)
* You can now schedule an activation schedule to turn off or turn on clusters and app services based on usage and no-traffic hours using [`couchbase-capella_cluster_onoff_schedule`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/couchbasecloud/couchbase-capella/latest/docs/resources/cluster_onoff_schedule)

Changes:

There are no deprecations as part of this release.

1.1.0 also includes general improvements and bug fixes. See the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/couchbase-cloud/terraform-provider-couchbase-capella/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for more specific information.

## Managing Scopes & Collections in Buckets

To create a new scope in a bucket, simply use the `scope` resource as follows:

```
resource "couchbase-capella_scope" "inventory" {
  scope_name      = "inventory"
  organization_id = var.organization_id
  project_id      = var.project_id
  cluster_id      = var.cluster_id
  bucket_id       = var.bucket_id
}
```

You can also use the `scopes` datasource to fetch existing list of scopes for the selected bucket.

```
output "scopes_list" {
  value = data.couchbase-capella_scopes.existing_scopes
}

data "couchbase-capella_scopes" "existing_scopes" {
  organization_id = var.organization_id
  project_id      = var.project_id
  cluster_id      = var.cluster_id
  bucket_id       = var.bucket_id
}
```

For more information, see the examples to manage scopes here: https://github.com/couchbase-cloud/terraform-provider-couchbase-capella/blob/master/examples/bucket/scopes 


To create a collection inside this scope, simply use the `collection` resource:

```
resource "couchbase-capella_collection" "books" {
  organization_id = var.organization_id
  project_id      = var.project_id
  cluster_id      = var.cluster_id
  bucket_id       = var.bucket_id
  scope_name      = couchbase-capella_scope.inventory.scope_name
  collection_name = "books"
  max_ttl         = var.collection.max_ttl
}
```

For more details, see the example for managing collections here: https://github.com/couchbase-cloud/terraform-provider-couchbase-capella/blob/master/examples/bucket/collections

For an end-to-end example on creating bucket, scope and collection together, refer to the [Getting Started](https://github.com/couchbase-cloud/terraform-provider-couchbase-capella/blob/master/examples/getting_started) example

## Importing Sample Buckets

To create a sample bucket and import a sample dataset, you can simply use the `sample_bucket` resource as follows:

```
resource "couchbase-capella_sample_bucket" "travel-sample" {
  name            = "travel-sample"
  organization_id = var.organization_id
  project_id      = var.project_id
  cluster_id      = var.cluster_id
}
```

The sample bucket name should be one of ['travel-sample', 'gamesim-sample', 'beer-sample'], if another name is used, the creation will fail.

Also check the examples here for more details: https://github.com/couchbase-cloud/terraform-provider-couchbase-capella/blob/master/examples/sample_bucket
